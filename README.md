Hello, I'm Emir. I'm new to Kotlin. Even though Windows theme was dark theme, I couldn't make the title bar of the application dark, so I researched this issue. I couldn't find any source on the internet regarding this subject, maybe mine is the first source xd. Anyway, this code finds your selected theme in Windows via the Registry and changes the title bar of your application accordingly using JNA. Additionally, I added the code that changes the background of the application. If you like the source, don't forget to star it :).
